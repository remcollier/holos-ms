#Â Example Project
I use VS Code

This code allows you to store farms in a fake database using a basic REST API

# Test HTTP
There is a set of test HTTP requests in the test.http file. You can execute these directly in VS code by installing the REST Client extension.

# Running the code
To run the code, write:
```
python3 app.py
```
